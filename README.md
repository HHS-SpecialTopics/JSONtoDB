# JSON to Database
**JSONtoDB** is a command-line tool allowing HTTP methods to be called from a terminal or other program.  It was originally intended
to be used to send requests from a client computer to a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) server using the [REST-API plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/).

## Installation
To install, use the standard RubyGems syntax:
```sh
$ gem install jsontodb
```
Or if necessary, you can add it to your `Gemfile`.
If you take this path, version `2.1.1` is the recommended earliest version in the `2.0` series, because all previous `2.x.x` version suffer from an issue in the `gemspec` that did not include default configuration files in the bundled gem.
```rb
gem 'jsontodb', '>= 2.1.1'
```
